ScienCulator is a Scientific Calculator, made by Ishan S Kshirsagar, a student of SCOE, Pune who is a basic level Python coder.

**TO GET STARTED**

1) Double click on the (digital-7.ttf) file, once opened, click on Install to install the font. This is a compulsory step, as 
   without the font, the app might misbehave and cause some bugs to rise to the surface.
2) To use the calculator, just open the .exe file, and you're good to go!

**SOME TIPS**

This calculator supports Keyboard and Mouse, both inputs. To know the shortcuts keys for various functions, kindly hover the cursor
over the required button. 
If you notice any bugs, errors, kindly report them to me :
